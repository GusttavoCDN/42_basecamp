## EXERCISE 04

* Create a function that displays 'N' or 'P' depending on the integer's sign entered as a parameter. If **n** is negative, display 'N', if **n** is positive or null, display 'P'.
* Here's how it should be prototyped:
    
  ```C
        void	ft_is_negative(int n);
    ```



# How an If statement works

An if statement is a way to do something based on a condition in or code. We can define different behaviors based on the condition.
The base structure is:

```c
    if (condition) 
    {
       // Do something 
    }
```

We can evaluate different conditions using a else if statement.

```c
    if (condition1) 
    {
       // Do something 
    } 
    else if (condition2) 
    {
       // Do something 
    } 
    else 
    {
       // Do something
       // If none of the above conditions are met will execute the code inside the else. 
    }
```

We can define as many conditions as we want.
